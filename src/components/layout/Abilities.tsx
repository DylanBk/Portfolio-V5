                    As a web developer and designer, I design and build visually stunning websites with a good flow using a diverse range of technologies. I aim to create sites that are dynamic, responsive and eye-catching while maintaining their core functionality.
                    <br /><br />When designing websites, I use tools such as Figma and draw.io to sketch wireframes and make detailed page designs, to maintain consistency throughout the design I design modular components such as the buttons, links, headings, etc.
                    <br /><br />I specialise in both front-end and back-end development. In the front-end area, I can use HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, JSX, and React. I prefer to use React in conjunction with Tailwind for rapid development as I can quickly create reusable components. My first programming language was Python so for the back-end I am most proficient with Flask combined with SQLite or SQLAlchemy, although I can also use Express.
