Apart from web development, I like working with data in Python using pandas and matplotlib to create dashboards and generate useful information. In addition to programming, I consistently go to the gym and go on long bike rides. Aside from being active, I enjoy cooking, eating, listening to music, reading, and playing games.</p>
